# ISTE Flutter Bootcamp

This repository contains the step by step guidance of flutter application development from beginner to intermediate level and the code taught during the bootcamp.

> **Notes**
>
> - Go through the official [Flutter installation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) document and install requirements mentioned as per the OS
> - Use official [Flutter documents](https://docs.flutter.dev/) on widgets or refer stackoverflow for development
> - <span style="color:red">Flutter is a frequently updating framework so the code base may change regularly. Relying too much on chat GPT or other AI tools can lead to errors</span>
> - The code base used for this can be found [here](https://github.com/aswin-asokan/iste_bootcamp/tree/main/code_base)
