# Task 2: Multi-Page App with CRUD operations

Design a **Multi-page** Flutter application with atleast the following requirements:

1. Login page (same as Task 1)
2. Registration page
3. Home page

> **Note**
> **CRUD** stands for **Create, Read, Update, and Delete**, representing the four fundamental operations used to manage data in databases and applications. These operations allow users to interact with data by adding new information, viewing existing data, modifying records, and removing unwanted data.

#### Registration page

The registration page should have:

- Textfields for email, name, password, and password confirmation
- Login button should check

  - If all fields are filled
  - Passwords match
  - Snackbar showing registration successful

- Add a button to navigate back to login page

#### Home page

The home page should have:

- A dynamic list view for displaying tasks
- A button to add new tasks
- Checkbox to mark completed tasks
- An option to delete tasks
- Option to edit tasks

### Sample output

<video height=350 controls>
  <source src="https://aswin-asokan.github.io/iste_bootcamp/videos/task_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
